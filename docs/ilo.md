# HPE iLO Management Provider

HPE Integrated Lights Out (iLO) is the management interface that is built into
HPE servers. Faros will connect over HTTPS to the iLO interface to control the
bare metal systems. To prepare an iLO interface for Faros, simply set the
Administrator password. All machines must have the same administrator password.
