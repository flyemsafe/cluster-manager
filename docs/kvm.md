# KVM Management Provider

Currently, the KVM provider can only be used for the bootstrap node and the
bastion app node. These nodes will be provisioned as virtual machines on the
bastion node and managed through the Qemu-KVM socket on that node.

If you would like to see this provider support additional nodes, please open an
issue.
